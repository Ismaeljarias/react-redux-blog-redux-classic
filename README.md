This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Redux Blog App

This is a React classic app, using Class components to use the old style way to implement Redux and Redux Thunk without any hooks
It is just a fetch from an api and bring some post and users and a simple implementation of Lodash to help us with some Memoization.

New update: I decide to remove Lodash since this memoization issue it can be resolve with simple Vanilla JS.
